<h1>On Includes</h1>

<p>Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive,

often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the

contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These

included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used

to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code

and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse

of code.</p>
