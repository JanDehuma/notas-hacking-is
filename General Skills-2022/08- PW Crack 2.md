# PW Crack 2
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level2.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level2.flag.txt.enc) in the same directory too.

#### Hints
- Does that encoding look familiar?
- The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
