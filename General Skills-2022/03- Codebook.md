# Codebook
Run the Python script `code.py` in the same directory as `codebook.txt`.

-   [Download code.py](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/101/code.py)
-   [Download codebook.txt](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/101/codebook.txt)

#### Hints
- On the webshell, use `ls` to see if both files are in the directory you are in
- The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
